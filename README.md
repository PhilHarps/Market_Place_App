### Tech Stack

> Identify and describe the software to be used in your App.

- HTML, CSS3, SCSS for visual styling
- GitHub for version control
- Ruby-on-Rails for development
- RSpec for testing
- Active Storage native to rails to handle file uploads and downloads
- Heroku for deployment
- Rails Gems (see below) for extending functionalities beyond MVC

> Describe the network infrastructure the App may be based on.

> Detail any third party services that your App will use.

#### Gem Dependencies

### Structure of Application

> Describe (in general terms) the data structure of marketplace apps that are similar to your own (e.g. eBay, Airbnb).


> Describe the architecture of your App. Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your App.

**Model**

**Controllers**

**Views**

The MVC separation of concerns was demonstrated by data validation handled within the models. Page redirection and ferrying form-submitted data happened in the controllers. And the views display different functions based on the type of user currently logged in.


### Project Plan & Design process

> Discuss how Agile methodology is being implemented in your project.



### Workflow of User Stories

> Provide User Stories for your App

### Wireframes for your application

> Provide Wireframes for your App.

### Testing

> Provide an overview and description of your Testing process.

### Database Structure Entity Relationship Diagrams

> Discuss the database relations to be implemented.

> Describe your project’s models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other.

> Provide your database schema design.

**Initial Design**

**Revised Design**

> Identify the database to be used in your App and provide a justification for your choice.

> Identify and describe the production database setup (i.e. postgres instance).


### Security

> Discuss and analyse requirements related to information system security.

> Research what your legal obligations are in relation to handling user data.
